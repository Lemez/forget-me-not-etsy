But categories are dangerous: some books are really about things they never explicitly mention, and some pretend to be about things that they're not; sometimes subsequent events give a book meanings it was never intended to have when it was written. With that in mind, here are five books, some well-known and some less so (and not all of them obvious choices), that concern or reflect upon or bear some meaningful relation to the Holocaust.
