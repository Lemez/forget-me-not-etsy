{"id":82,"url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/children/booklists/82/","title":"Five of the Greatest Books about the Holocaust","list_description":"How do you define 'Holocaust literature'? The idea itself seems absurd, if not obscene; but the efforts of writers and philosophers to understand one of the most incomprehensible events in human history have produced mountains of books, some of them truly great, and it's an understandable instinct to lump them all together under a definable category. But categories are dangerous: some books are really about things they never explicitly mention, and some pretend to be about things that they're not; sometimes subsequent events give a book meanings it was never intended to have when it was written. With that in mind, here are five books, some well-known and some less so (and not all of them obvious choices), that concern or reflect upon or bear some meaningful relation to the Holocaust. Not all of them would sit comfortably on a shelf marked 'Holocaust Literature', and this is by no means a 'best-of' list; instead, we hope these books might open up new perspectives or introduce you to writers you hadn't yet encountered.","books":[{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/31239/babi-yar.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/31239","title":"Babi Yar","author":"by Anatoly Kuznetsov","description":"Babi Yar is the name of a ravine on the outskirts of Kiev, where between 1941 and 1943 the Nazis murdered untold numbers of Jews, Roma, the disabled, Ukrainian resisters and hostages."},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/31279/the-drowned-and-the-saved.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/31279","title":"The Drowned and the Saved","author":"by Primo Levi","description":"The Drowned and the Saved was written towards the end of Primo Levi's life, and unlike his earlier memoirs If This is a Man and The Truce, it doesn't explicitly narrate his experiences in Auschwitz and after liberation."},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/31281/the-wandering-jews.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/31281","title":"The Wandering Jews","author":"by Joseph Roth","description":"Finally, a book about what was lost.

As many as one in ten children and young people aged five to 16 have a diagnosable mental health disorder - that is three in any one classroom.  By adulthood, the figure rises to one in four, meaning many children will come into contact with relatives or other adults who are affected.  Books that acknowledge and explore mental health problems can help to increase awareness, encourage dialogue, reduce stigma and develop real understanding. Such books are still fairly rare, but the following teen/young adult reads offer a range of different perspectives and are well worth seeking out.","books":[{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/34805/am-i-normal-yet.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/34805","title":"Am I Normal Yet?","author":"by Holly Bourne","description":"This is a powerful and engrossing read that successfully informs, shocks, reassures and entertains in equal measures.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 14+","interest_age":"Interest level: 14+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/34897/aubrey-and-the-terrible-yoot.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/34897","title":"Aubrey and the Terrible Yoot","author":"by Horatio Clare","description":"This fabulously illustrated book addresses the difficult subject of parental depression, at once describing the horror of Aubrey’s dad’s experience but also remaining upbeat and full of surreal humour.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 8+","interest_age":"Interest level: 8-12"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/29391/bang-bang-you-re-dead.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/29391","title":"Bang, Bang, You're Dead!","author":"by Narinder Dhami","description":"Dhami's thriller takes us from a dysfunctional home, where twins Mia and Jamie live with their divorced mother, to a school siege in which a pupil holds a class hostage.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 9+","interest_age":"Interest level: 9+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/29216/runningoncracks.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/29216","title":"Running on the Cracks","author":"by Julia Donaldson","description":"Donaldson's style engages immediately and through her characters she raises many questions about our attitudes to those perceived as ‘different'.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 11+","interest_age":"Interest level: 11+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/33906/finding-a-voice.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/33906","title":"Finding a Voice","author":"by Kim Hood","description":"This is an engaging story about the two-way nature of friendship and the risks of making assumptions.

Viewers would have seen how the two competing teams had to create, design and sell a children's book for 3-5 year-olds in two days. Creating a children's book from start to finish is no easy job and both teams fell a little short when trying to put a children's book together in just 48 hours. One team created Bizzy Bee's First Adventure, a book about a bee who's trying to make honey, and the other team created Snottydink, a tale about a dragon that's a bit like an elephant.  So, we thought we'd show the teams what they're up against as we highlight some of the more celebrated books about bees and dragons.","books":[{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/32288/9781406304916-1-.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/32288","title":"A First Book of Nature","author":"by Nicola Davies","description":"Hearld's nostalgic illustrations are the perfect accompaniment to this lovely chronicle of a child's first experiences of nature","reading_age":"Reading Age: 6+","interest_age":"Interest level: 4+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/30838/zog.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/30838","title":"Zog","author":"by Julia Donaldson","description":"Zog is a keen dragon at Dragon School who aims to be the best in his class and win a golden star.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 6+","interest_age":"Interest level: 3+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/33966/dragon-loves-penguin.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/33966","title":"Dragon Loves Penguin","author":"by Debi Gliori","description":"The dragons have settled in the land of ice and snow, and their eggs are waiting to hatch, but one dragon doesn't have an egg to care for.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 5+","interest_age":"Interest level: 2+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/32907/9780330544030-1-.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/32907","title":"Again!","author":"by Emily Gravett","description":"It's Cedric's the little dragon's bedtime, but before he goes to sleep, there's just enough time for mum to read him a bedtime story.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 6+","interest_age":"Interest level: 2+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/25585/9780141500577-1-.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/25585","title":"Guess What I Found in Dragon Wood","author":"by Timothy Knapman","description":"Dragon is excited – and just a little scared – when he finds the Benjamin","reading_age":"Reading Age: 5+","interest_age":"Interest level: 3+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/29137/winnie-the-pooh-and-ten-busy-bees.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/29137","title":"Winnie-the-Pooh and Ten Busy Bees","author":"by A A Milne","description":"Winnie-the-Pooh counts the reader down from ten to zero, ably assisted by the appropriate number of elevated plastic bees.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 5+","interest_age":"Interest level: 2+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/31589/cat-in-the-hat.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/31589","title":"The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That: Show Me The Honey","author":"by Tish Rabe","description":"Includes easy and funny rhymes which children will love to read again and again","reading_age":"Reading Age: 6+","interest_age":"Interest level: 4+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/29278/sylvia-and-bird.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/29278","title":"Sylvia and Bird","author":"by Catherine Rayner","description":"A story that gently explores themes of expectation, loneliness, friendship and valuing others.","reading_age":"Reading Age: 6+","interest_age":"Interest level: 3+"},{"img":"https://artlogic-res.cloudinary.com/w_120,c_limit/ws-booktrustfileserver/usr/images/books/main_image/32504/9781849415019-1-.jpg","url":"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/32504","title":"Knight School","author":"by Marilyn Singer","description":"Little Knight and Little Dragon are the best of friends and they can't wait to start school.
